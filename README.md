# Title:AI-driven-Confidential-Defense-Strategy-Generation-Technology

# Summary of your project/项目摘要
对于企业信息安全建设而言，面临攻防不对等的局势，为了更有效对抗未知风险，需要将以往的黑名单策略升级为白名单策略，只允许预期内行为的发生，而白名单策略现有制造流程极其依赖人工，成本高，效率低。本方案旨在通过大模型帮助甚至替代人工分析数据，赋予数据以含义，找出数据的共性和特殊性、最大公约数和最小公倍数，智能生成白名单可信策略，拦截和检测攻击者的攻击行为，打破攻击者攻击行动链路。

For enterprise information security construction, facing the situation of unequal attack and defense, in order to more effectively combat unknown risks, it is necessary to upgrade the previous blacklist strategy to a whitelist strategy, which only allows expected behaviors to occur, while the whitelist strategy currently manufactures The process is extremely labor dependent, with high cost and low efficiency. This solution aims to help or even replace manual analysis of data through large models, give meaning to data, find out commonality and particularity, greatest common divisor and least common multiple of data, intelligently generate whitelist trusted policies, intercept and detect attackers' attacks Behavior, breaking the attacker's attack action link.
